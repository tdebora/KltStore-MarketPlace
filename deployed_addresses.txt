#### Deploy the contract
Till now, we have created smart contract and compiled. Now the time for deploy the contract to blockchain which is the ganache, the test blockchain.
For that, we need to configure this project with the blockchain address and port number which is available in ganache settings. We can provide this information truffle.js or truffle-config.js in the project folder.
```sh
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: '127.0.0.1',
      port: 7545,
      network_id: '*' // Match any network id
    }
  }};
```
##### 6. Metamask
Metamask acts as web3 injector to our page.

- Add extension to your chrome browser
- Add custom RPC with your ganache rpc url which would http://localhost:7545
- You can see your ganache generated first account in metamask accounts list
- You user submits a change from page which invokes the contract method, metamask asks for confirmation
